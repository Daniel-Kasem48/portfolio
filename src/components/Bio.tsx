            I have four years of experience in full-stack web development, with a primary focus on backend technologies. For three years, I excelled in PHP, particularly within the Laravel framework. Over the last two years, I transitioned to Node.js, specializing in Express and Nest.js for backend development. Alongside backend expertise, I am proficient in frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with experience using frameworks like React and Vue.js. My database skills encompass MySQL and PostgreSQL. My approach to development prioritizes project success, and I am dedicated to staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies
